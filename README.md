# Lehni VS Code theme

A light VS Code color theme that combines the `colors` (UI/UX) from the [GitHub
theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
and the `tokenColors` (syntax highlighting) from the [Ayu
theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu), along
with further adjustments and refinements for the [Babel
JavaScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel)
syntax highlighter.

Looks great on macOS when combined with the [Customize
UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iocave.customize-ui)
extension, along with these settings in your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "window.titleBarStyle": "native",
  "customizeUI.titleBar": "inline",
  "customizeUI.activityBar": "wide"
}
```
